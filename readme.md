## Rules, Practices and Principles

1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming should be in camel case.
   - Camel case is a naming format where there is no white space in the separation of each word; the first word is in all lower case while the succeeding words' first letter are in upper case followed by lower-cased letters.
   - e.g., buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names is a must, and relates to what it is doing or the data it holds.
7. File Structure to follow below:



```
WD-ProjectName
└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
|   └─ js
|       └─ script.js
└─ pages
|  └─ pageName
